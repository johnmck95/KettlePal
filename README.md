## Welcome to KettlePal!

KettlePal was built for two reasons:

1. To gain hands-on experience building a production grade full-stack application.
2. To quantitiatively track my kettlebell workouts over time, helping overcome plateaus by systematically increasing work capacity.

KettlePal has a small, but growing user-base. To cover the cloud computing costs, KettlePal will be moving to a donation-based payment model. As long as the donations roughly cover the fixed expenses, I have no intention of hiding the application behind a paywall.
